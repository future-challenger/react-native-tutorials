##React Native with Redux

This app mostly looks like [This One][1]. According to the article, all visible to-do items will show in a list. You can add one, and search items by enter a filter string.

One thing you will have to pay attention to is the difference between *Presentational Components* and *Container Components*. If you know little about it, you can know it from table below:


|         | Presentational Components        | Container Components                           |
|:-------:|:--------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
| Purpose | How things look (markup, styles) | How things work (data fetching, state updates) |
|**Aware of Redux**|No|Yes|
|**To read data**|Read data from props|Subscribe to Redux state|
|**To change data**|Invoke callbacks from props|Dispatch Redux actions|
|**Are written**|By hand|Usually generated by React Redux|

###What Redux Do
For now, lots of guys know *Redux* is cool. When you try to learn it, you may find lots of concepts to learn. Then you may lost in those fancy terms.

Leave those fancy words there, just follow me. Redux deals with the data thing in React components, *State*, *Props*. When you import Redux in, you will have to modify those states and props in different components.

Redux principle one: *Put state of whole app in store*.
This is the beginning of Redux powered React (Native) app.

Redux principle two: *Modify state with actions*.
When state in a component changes, React render it. So when we need a render, use 'this.setState' method to make it happen.
